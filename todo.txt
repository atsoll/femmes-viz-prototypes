graphs to do

overall gender comparison
  - stacked bar per season, reps + recettes
  - could do a streamgraph of the same

women play timeline, with colour coding for genre
  - do it as a bubble timeline and make radius correspond to revenue in creation season (do rev as a percentage or total)
  - do one agged over all time? probs doesn't make a ton of sense...just let the lines collapse

top authors, reps + recettes, with perspective
  - overall and by decade can do as circle packing
  - want something to show ripple effect before and after creation, compared with similar men (genre)
  - could do something bullseye like for after, but before is hard
      - could do a sort of bastardized violin plot..recettes on one side, reps on the other..would have to transfrom to be %
      - ...or maybe just a stream graph (with a vertical line)

   - just circle packing overall?
    - rec still need to be relative in some way
    - keep within decades do
        - play circle packing by delta expected??? doesn't take into account programmtic strategy though
        - perc total b/c there might not be a ton of inflation?



some  more affective ones
- spiral bar for presence
- circle packing for creations with a single season (rec) .. not women only


do a bar graph of all authors to basically talk about programmatic strategies
- compare avg expected vs avg how much they did
    - goal is to basically show how much they were able to defy programmatic strategy
